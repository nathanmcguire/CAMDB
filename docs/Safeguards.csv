CIS,16,13,Software,Govern,Conduct Application Penetration Testing,"Conduct application penetration testing. For critical applications, authenticated penetration testing is better suited to finding business logic vulnerabilities than code scanning and automated security testing. Penetration testing relies on the skill of the tester to manually manipulate an application as an authenticated and unauthenticated user.",IG3
CIS,16,14,Software,Protect,Conduct Threat Modeling,"Conduct threat modeling. Threat modeling is the process of identifying and addressing application security design flaws within a design, before code is created. It is conducted through specially trained individuals who evaluate the application design and gauge security risks for each entry point and access level. The goal is to map out the application, architecture, and infrastructure in a structured way to understand its weaknesses.",IG3
CIS,17,1,Users,Respond,Designate Personnel to Manage Incident Handling,"Designate one key person, and at least one backup, who will manage the enterprise's incident handling process. Management personnel are responsible for the coordination and documentation of incident response and recovery efforts and can consist of employees internal to the enterprise, service providers, or a hybrid approach. If using a service provider, designate at least one person internal to the enterprise to oversee any third-party work. Review annually, or when significant enterprise changes occur that could impact this Safeguard.",IG1
CIS,17,2,Documentation,Govern,Establish and Maintain Contact Information for Reporting Security Incidents,"Establish and maintain contact information for parties that need to be informed of security incidents. Contacts may include internal staff, service vendors, law enforcement, cyber insurance providers, relevant government agencies, Information Sharing and Analysis Center (ISAC) partners, or other stakeholders. Verify contacts annually to ensure that information is up to date.",IG1
CIS,17,3,Documentation,Govern,Establish and Maintain an Enterprise Process for Reporting Incidents,"Establish and maintain a documented enterprise process for the workforce to report security incidents. The process includes reporting timeframe, personnel to report to, mechanism for reporting, and the minimum information to be reported. Ensure the process is publicly available to all of the workforce. Review annually, or when significant enterprise changes occur that could impact this Safeguard.",IG1
CIS,17,4,Documentation,Govern,Establish and Maintain an Incident Response Process,"Establish and maintain a documented incident response process that addresses roles and responsibilities, compliance requirements, and a communication plan. Review annually, or when significant enterprise changes occur that could impact this Safeguard.",IG2
CIS,17,5,Users,Respond,Assign Key Roles and Responsibilities,"Assign key roles and responsibilities for incident response, including staff from legal, IT, information security, facilities, public relations, human resources, incident responders, and analysts. Review annually, or when significant enterprise changes occur that could impact this Safeguard.",IG2
CIS,17,6,Users,Respond,Define Mechanisms for Communicating During Incident Response,"Determine which primary and secondary mechanisms will be used to communicate and report during a security incident. Mechanisms can include phone calls, emails, secure chat, or notification letters. Keep in mind that certain mechanisms, such as emails, can be affected during a security incident. Review annually, or when significant enterprise changes occur that could impact this Safeguard.",IG2
CIS,17,7,Users,Recover,Conduct Routine Incident Response Exercises,"Plan and conduct routine incident response exercises and scenarios for key personnel involved in the incident response process to prepare for responding to real-world incidents. Exercises need to test communication channels, decision-making, and workflows. Conduct testing on an annual basis, at a minimum.",IG2
CIS,17,8,Users,Recover,Conduct Post-Incident Reviews,Conduct post-incident reviews. Post-incident reviews help prevent incident recurrence through identifying lessons learned and follow-up action.,IG2
CIS,17,9,Documentation,Recover,Establish and Maintain Security Incident Thresholds,"Establish and maintain security incident thresholds, including, at a minimum, differentiating between an incident and an event. Examples can include: abnormal activity, security vulnerability, security weakness, data breach, privacy incident, etc. Review annually, or when significant enterprise changes occur that could impact this Safeguard.",IG3
CIS,18,1,Documentation,Govern,Establish and Maintain a Penetration Testing Program,"Establish and maintain a penetration testing program appropriate to the size, complexity, industry, and maturity of the enterprise. Penetration testing program characteristics include scope, such as network, web application, Application Programming Interface (API), hosted services, and physical premise controls; frequency; limitations, such as acceptable hours, and excluded attack types; point of contact information; remediation, such as how findings will be routed internally; and retrospective requirements.",IG2
CIS,18,2,Network,Detect,Perform Periodic External Penetration Tests,"Perform periodic external penetration tests based on program requirements, no less than annually. External penetration testing must include enterprise and environmental reconnaissance to detect exploitable information. Penetration testing requires specialized skills and experience and must be conducted through a qualified party. The testing may be clear box or opaque box.",IG2
CIS,18,3,Network,Protect,Remediate Penetration Test Findings,Remediate penetration test findings based on the enterprise's documented vulnerability remediation process. This should include determining a timeline and level of effort based on the impact and prioritization of each identified finding.,IG2
